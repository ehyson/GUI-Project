Welcome to Eric Hyson’s Maxwell’s Demon Game! Follow these steps to enjoy this wonderful game :)

1) Go to the class entitled “Main” and run the file. A new game window will pop up with two chambers.
2) The border’s of the play-space is marked with black lines. For a maximum playing experience, adjust the window to align with these borders. 
3) Click the “Add Balls” button to add one ball to each side of the chamber: one red, fast ball and one blue, slow ball. Go ahead, add as many as you want!
4) Clicking anywhere in the window will open a “door” in the middle of the barrier, allowing the balls to move from one chamber to another.
5) As balls move between chambers, watch how the average speed of each side change with the temperature display at the top of each chamber.
6) If you wish to restart the game, click the “Reset Game” button to restore to the game to the opening state with no balls.
